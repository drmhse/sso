# AuthOS tenant-resource inventory

Status: source-derived isolation-test scope

Reviewed: 2026-07-14

This inventory identifies data that must be tenant-isolated and the context by
which that isolation is derived. It is not a claim that every handler is already
covered. Its purpose is to make omissions visible and to drive a generated
authorization test matrix.

See the [threat model](./threat-model.md) and
[security architecture](./security-architecture.md) for the surrounding trust
boundaries.

## Scoping model

AuthOS uses four principal scope roots:

- **Organization-scoped:** the record contains `org_id` or is the organization.
- **Service-derived:** the record contains `service_id`; the service contains
  `org_id`.
- **User-derived:** the record contains `user_id`; tenant access must be proven
  through the user's scoped account or membership and, where relevant, a
  service/organization context. A user may participate in multiple
  organizations, so `user_id` alone is not always a tenant predicate.
- **Platform/global:** the record intentionally spans tenants and must be
  limited to platform-owner or internal-job access, or contain no tenant data.

The reviewed database is shared and no database row-level-security policy was
found. Foreign keys and cascading deletes protect referential integrity, but do
not authorize a request. Route path slugs, request headers, JWT organization
claims, and client-supplied IDs are untrusted selectors until resolved and
checked against the authenticated principal.

## User-owned and context-dependent resources

| Resource/entity | Scope derivation | Security-sensitive contents | Expected enforcement and required deny tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | `id`; optional `org_id`; memberships; platform flag | Email, password hash, verification, deletion, platform authority | Self or explicit tenant/platform administration; scoped email lookup; prevent platform-flag mutation; deny other user and same-email cross-context confusion. |

| `mfa_audit_log` | `user_id`, optional `org_id` | Authentication outcomes, IP/user agent, details | Self/platform or authorized tenant security view; ensure optional org cannot leak into tenant queries. |
| `mfa_failure_patterns` | optional `user_id`/`org_id` | Detection aggregates | Authorized security/platform use; partition tenant queries and test null/global rows. |
| `audit_outbox` | serialized event payload re-derives organization/user/service scope by event kind | Durable pending audit events and delivery error state | Internal worker only; validate event-kind payload schema, preserve tenant identifiers during reconciliation, redact secrets, and test dead-letter/replay isolation. |

## Platform and internal resources

| Resource/entity | Intended scope | Required controls and tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform-owner user flag and platform routes | Platform | Check current database user, not client claims alone; test demotion/cache staleness, MFA policy, bootstrap closure, and tenant-admin denial. |
| `platform_audit_log` | Platform | Platform-owner read access only; redact secrets/PII; test actor/impersonation attribution and cross-role denial. |
| `organization_tiers` and `plans`/feature governance | Platform definitions with tenant assignments | Platform-owner mutations; tenant reads only where intended; deny tenant write and arbitrary tier escalation. |
| `mfa_daily_metrics` | Optional organization or platform aggregate | Explicit org filter for tenant views; platform-only global rows; test null-org handling. |
| `system_jobs` | Internal job queue | No tenant-controlled arbitrary job type/payload; job payload authorization and redaction; idempotency and operator access tests. |
| `distributed_locks`, `token_refresh_locks` | Internal coordination | Namespaced keys, bounded expiry, multi-replica atomicity, no public CRUD route. |
| `webhook_deliveries` and job payloads | Derived tenant/internal | Carry immutable parent IDs and reauthorize on administrative reads/retries. |
| AuthOS capability metadata/JWKS and health/readiness | Public/operational | Publish only implemented capabilities, return `404` for unsupported standards discovery, and restrict operational details at the proxy where required. |
| Metrics | Operational, disabled by default | Require the configured application bearer token plus network/proxy restriction; test no secrets/tenant labels. |
| Managed bootstrap config/state files | Host/platform | Platform-owner plus filesystem/process controls; validate paths/content; audit changes; test bootstrap cannot re-open privilege. |

## Cross-resource invariants

Every handler and store operation must preserve these invariants:

1. A service, plan, API key, subscription, SAML key/state, authorization grant,
   provider-token request, or service-provider grant belongs to the same
   organization/service context used to authorize the actor.
2. A resource ID is never authorized merely because the actor can access an
   organization named elsewhere in the request.
3. A user's organization membership does not grant access to all of that
   user's records from other organizations or platform context.
4. A platform owner uses an explicit platform path/check; tenant checks do not
   accidentally treat platform ownership as implicit membership unless the
   operation's policy says so.
5. API-key and SCIM-token authority comes from the stored principal binding,
   not from `X-Organization-ID`, path slugs, body fields, or JWT claims supplied
   alongside it.
6. Delete, update, rotate, revoke, accept, retry, and test endpoints enforce the
   same parent scope as list/get endpoints.
7. Background jobs re-derive tenant ownership from stored parent IDs instead of
   trusting serialized tenant fields.
8. Cache keys include every scope dimension that affects authorization, and
   privilege changes invalidate or safely age out cached results.
9. Tenant deletion cascades or explicitly handles every derived resource and
   does not delete a shared user's unrelated identity data.
10. Platform analytics may aggregate tenants only for platform-authorized
    callers; tenant analytics always apply an organization predicate before
    pagination/aggregation.

## Required authorization matrix

For each inventory row and each CRUD/action endpoint, automated tests must
cover at least:

| Dimension | Required cases |
| --- | --- |
| Actor | Unauthenticated, end user/self, other user, member, custom role, admin, owner, platform owner, service key with/without permission, SCIM token. |
| Tenant | Same organization, different organization, no membership, suspended/pending organization, deleted parent. |
| Identifier | Correct ID, another tenant's valid ID, nonexistent ID, parent/child mismatch, duplicate slug/email/provider subject. |
| Operation | List, get, create, update/patch, delete, rotate/revoke, accept/complete, test/retry, export/analytics. |
| Timing | Concurrent mutation/consume, privilege revoked during cached window, expired credential/state, parent deleted during action. |
| Database | SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL using the shipped feature combinations. |

Tests should prefer indistinguishable not-found/forbidden behavior where
resource-existence disclosure matters, and should assert both response and
database state. A passing happy-path test is not isolation evidence.

## Recorded isolation evidence

The following focused regressions exist on the current development baseline.
They are evidence for only the cases named here, not completion of the matrix:

| Resource | Database | Test identifier | Covered cases | Remaining gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webhooks` | SQLite | `store::webhooks::tests::webhook_lists_and_event_selection_are_organization_scoped` | Two organizations with valid webhook IDs; organization-scoped list/count and active event selection return only the selected organization's row; a nonexistent organization returns an empty list. | HTTP handler authentication/role cases, delivery-history endpoints, concurrent changes, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Organization selection and capability authority | SQLite | `handlers::organizations::core::tests::select_organization_switches_multi_org_member_and_persists_session_scope`; `handlers::organizations::core::tests::select_organization_rejects_inactive_target_org`; `handlers::organizations::core::tests::select_organization_rejects_non_member_target_org`; `handlers::organizations::core::tests::tenant_capability_does_not_trust_stale_platform_owner_snapshot` | A multi-organization member can select only an active organization they belong to, and the resulting signed/session context is rebound to that organization; inactive and non-member targets are denied. Tenant capability helpers re-read a claimed platform owner from the database, so a stale privileged snapshot cannot bypass tenant membership after demotion. | Full organization CRUD actor/child-ID matrix, pending/deleted parents, distributed cache timing, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| `webhooks` | SQLite | `store::webhooks::tests::webhook_mutations_deny_other_organization_and_missing_ids` | Same-organization update/delete succeeds; another organization's valid ID and nonexistent IDs produce `NotFound`; denied URL/event/status updates and delete leave the row unchanged. | HTTP response equivalence, test-delivery authorization, secret redaction/rotation, concurrent changes, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Webhook delivery worker | SQLite | `store::webhook_deliveries::tests::pending_delivery_polling_reauthorizes_active_parent_and_honors_limit` | Pending polling and the worker's exact delivery/webhook lookup join the stored webhook and organization, require both active, reject mismatched payload IDs, and exclude exhausted work. The worker rechecks that exact authority immediately before outbound I/O; suspension after enqueue prevents authorization, and retry/failure bookkeeping cannot select an unrelated earlier delivery. | Suspension in the final database-check-to-network-send interval, multi-replica claim/lease, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Billing webhook subscriptions | SQLite | `handlers::webhook::tests::subscription_webhook_rejects_cross_tenant_metadata_and_preserves_state` | A valid customer from organization A cannot use organization B user/service/plan metadata to create or mutate subscriptions; denied state remains equivalent for the asserted fields. | Valid-flow route fixture, other event types, concurrency, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Service identities | SQLite | `store::identities::tests::service_principal_queries_reject_inconsistent_cross_tenant_identity_context` | Deliberately inconsistent identity rows cannot make another tenant's user visible through service-principal existence, count, or list queries. | HTTP provider-token non-disclosure, all permissions, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| `api_keys` | SQLite | `store::api_keys::tests::delete_for_service_denies_cross_tenant_key_and_preserves_target` | A valid key ID from another service returns `NotFound`; the target row is unchanged; same-service deletion succeeds. | HTTP actor/capability matrix, races, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| `plans` | SQLite | `store::plans::tests::plan_mutations_require_parent_service_and_preserve_other_tenant` | Update and delete use the compound service/plan predicate; another tenant's valid plan ID returns `NotFound` and preserves all asserted fields, while same-service mutations succeed. | HTTP owner/admin/custom/service-grant matrix, subscription races, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Organization billing credentials | SQLite | `store::organization_billing_credentials::tests::billing_credential_mutations_are_org_scoped_and_preserve_other_tenant`; `handlers::organizations::billing_credentials::tests::billing_credentials_authority_honors_scoped_capability_and_revocation` | Wrong-organization disable/delete affect zero rows and preserve the other tenant's ciphertext, key ID, and enabled state. A custom billing role is accepted only while its membership and organization are active; suspended-parent and revoked-role checks deny access. | Full provider handler matrix, concurrent upsert, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Domain routes | SQLite | `handlers::organizations::domain_routing::tests::domain_route_mutations_reject_cross_org_id_and_preserve_target`; `handlers::organizations::domain_routing::tests::domain_route_mutations_reject_suspended_parent_and_preserve_state` | Cross-organization route IDs are hidden and leave policy, verification state/token, and ownership unchanged. Suspended parents deny update/delete and preserve the row. Verification and deletion stores use compound organization/domain predicates. | DNS/HTTP verification success fixtures, all actor roles, concurrent ownership changes, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| SIEM configurations | SQLite | `store::siem_configs::tests::siem_config_mutations_are_org_scoped_and_preserve_results`; `handlers::siem_configs::secret_tests::siem_runtime_rejects_plaintext_and_wrong_context_without_fallback`; `handlers::siem_configs::secret_tests::siem_test_credentials_are_provider_specific_and_fail_closed`; `handlers::siem_configs::secret_tests::siem_api_response_never_serializes_credential_columns` | Update/delete use compound organization/config predicates; a valid other-tenant config ID returns `NotFound` and leaves the endpoint, encrypted API key, enabled state, name, and owner unchanged. SIEM test authentication decrypts only the provider-selected credential with authenticated record/field context, requires API keys for named providers, rejects unsafe custom header names, bounds downstream bodies, and returns no downstream body/error detail. API responses omit both credential columns and ciphertext canaries. | Full handler actor/test-action network matrix, concurrent delivery/rotation, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| SCIM token lifecycle | SQLite | `store::scim_tokens::tests::scim_token_lifecycle_is_org_scoped_and_preserves_other_tenant` | Revoke and delete use compound organization/token predicates; another tenant's valid ID is a no-op and remains active/present, while same-organization operations succeed. | HTTP actor/status matrix, remaining resource-ID cases, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Organization audit authority | SQLite | `handlers::organization_audit::tests::audit_route_authority_is_bound_to_selected_organization`; `handlers::organization_audit::tests::audit_metadata_recursively_redacts_credentials_but_preserves_identifiers`; `handlers::platform::audit_redaction_tests::platform_audit_metadata_uses_recursive_credential_redaction` | Access is resolved from the selected organization, requires its scoped capability and active status, and rejects other/missing organizations. Target/action filters keep the organization predicate, filtered totals match the selected query, and target pagination never returns the other tenant's same target ID. Pagination uses a stable created-time/ID order, including when rows share a timestamp. Structured organization and platform response metadata recursively redacts credential keys while retaining non-secret identifiers; malformed platform metadata fails closed instead of returning raw text. | Remaining PII/free-form metadata policy and export behavior, remaining filter combinations and actor roles, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Tenant login analytics authority | SQLite | `handlers::analytics::tests::tenant_analytics_requires_live_scoped_capability_and_excludes_other_scopes` | All tenant analytics routes resolve a currently active parent and require `audit_logs.view`: owner/admin/custom-capability actors are allowed, while member/non-member/other-tenant actors, suspended parents, and live capability revocation are denied. Tenant aggregation includes explicit-org service-less events and compatible legacy service-derived events, while excluding null-scope, other-service, and inconsistent org/service pairs. Recent-login service IDs are nullable and signed limits are clamped before unsigned query conversion. The same predicate scopes risk-event reads. | Date-filter response combinations, metadata/redaction and null-org MFA rows, any future export surface, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| SCIM runtime parent and shared-user isolation | SQLite | `handlers::scim::tests::suspended_parent_rejects_every_scim_route_before_handler_state_changes`; `handlers::scim::tests::shared_user_put_and_patch_cannot_mutate_global_identity`; `handlers::scim::tests::optional_organization_header_must_be_absent_or_exactly_match_token_scope` | SCIM bearer authentication joins the token to a currently active parent organization before every route. PUT/PATCH can update global user fields only for a user record owned by that organization and with a live membership; membership-only/shared users are unchanged and denied. The optional organization header may be absent or exactly match the token scope; mismatched, malformed, whitespace-different, or duplicate values fail closed and never select authority. | Final-check-to-mutation suspension timing, deprovision/reprovision policy for shared identities, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Risk rules | SQLite | `store::risk_rules::tests::risk_rule_update_and_delete_preserve_other_organization` | Rule update/delete predicates use the selected organization ID; mutating one organization's policy leaves the other organization's ID, mode, and thresholds unchanged. Risk handlers also reject inactive parents before reads, updates, resets, or event queries. | Handler custom-role/reset/event pagination and unchanged-state matrix, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Organization sessions | SQLite | `store::sessions::tests::org_scoped_session_revocation_preserves_other_tenant_and_other_user` | Revocation removes only the selected user and organization scope while preserving the same user's other-tenant session and another user's same-org session. | Handler roles, global/resource sessions, concurrency, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Same-email user contexts | SQLite | `store::users::tests::same_email_lookups_and_default_creation_preserve_tenant_context` | Organization A, organization B, and platform users with the same email resolve independently; default/admin-OAuth creation cannot select or promote a tenant account. | Full password/magic/OAuth handler matrix, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Magic-link bound context and consumption | SQLite | `handlers::auth::magic::tests::malformed_callback_and_suspension_after_issuance_preserve_magic_link`; `handlers::auth::magic::tests::same_email_and_cross_service_context_cannot_select_or_consume_wrong_identity`; `store::magic_links::tests::concurrent_consumption_has_exactly_one_winner` | Issuance and verification require a currently active bound organization and exact service access. Callback state/redirect and all fallible authorization/risk prerequisites run before consume; malformed, suspended, and cross-service denials preserve the link. Successful consume/session/device creation is one transaction and consume-time authority is rechecked; replay has one winner. | PostgreSQL/MySQL route parity, multi-replica timing, and durable authentication audit coverage. |
| Invitation same-email tenant binding | SQLite | `handlers::invitations::tests::invitation_acceptance_ignores_platform_and_sibling_same_email_users`; `handlers::invitations::tests::concurrent_invited_user_resolution_has_one_tenant_identity`; `handlers::invitations::tests::suspended_parent_rejects_invitation_acceptance_without_state_changes` | Acceptance reuses a shared identity only when membership already proves the exact organization binding; otherwise it resolves or creates by `(org_id,email)`. Platform and sibling-tenant same-email rows remain unchanged, while concurrent resolution converges on one target-tenant identity. Acceptance conditionally claims a pending invitation only for an active parent before user/membership side effects; a suspended parent leaves the invitation pending and creates neither user nor membership. Create, admin-accept, cancel, and list also require an active parent, and list responses do not expose the stored token hash. | PostgreSQL/MySQL concurrency and the remaining full actor/ID route matrix. |
| Connected accounts | SQLite | `store::connected_accounts::tests::linked_account_ownership_and_provider_subject_collision_are_enforced` | Other users cannot read or revoke an account, denied mutations preserve token/status state, and one external provider subject cannot be linked to a second user. | Grant and callback handler matrix, encrypted-token canaries, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Provider grants and completion state | SQLite | `store::service_provider_grants::tests::provider_grants_require_owned_matching_account_and_preserve_denied_state`; `store::provider_token_requests::tests::provider_token_request_completion_is_user_bound_and_one_time` | Grant creation requires an active account owned by the same user with the same provider; denied cross-user/provider writes preserve active grant state. Request completion is user-bound and has exactly one winner, and handlers claim it before grant mutation. | External callback failure injection, multi-replica races, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| User devices | SQLite | `store::user_devices::tests::user_scoped_device_mutations_deny_other_user_and_preserve_state` | Rename, trust-extension, revoke, and delete mutations carry the authenticated user predicate; denied writes preserve name, expiry, and trust state. | Full HTTP actor matrix, device-cookie replay, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| User passkeys | SQLite | `store::user_passkeys::tests::passkey_management_denies_other_user_and_preserves_target` | Other-user lookups, rename, and deletion fail without changing credential state; owner mutations remain available. | Browser/authenticator ceremonies, handler matrix, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Platform authority | Structural plus SQLite authority | `router::platform_route_boundary_tests::every_platform_route_is_inside_the_platform_owner_boundary`; `middleware::platform_authority_tests::platform_authority_uses_current_database_role_not_cached_snapshot`; `middleware::impersonation_authority_tests::platform_actor_demotion_immediately_removes_global_impersonation_authority` | Every inventoried platform method is behind JWT extraction and a current-database platform-owner check; tenant roles and stale/demoted impersonation authority do not satisfy it. | Platform audit redaction/attribution, internal job payload authorization, distributed sessions, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. |
| Public operational responses | SQLite plus pure response tests | `handlers::health::tests::public_health_responses_have_a_bounded_non_tenant_shape`; `jwks_tests::jwks_publishes_active_and_previous_verification_keys`; `http_security::tests::metrics_requires_the_exact_bearer_token` | Health/readiness expose a fixed non-tenant shape, JWKS contains only public verification material, and metrics requires the exact configured bearer token. | Deployment proxy/network-boundary checks and runtime secret canaries. |

## Inventory maintenance

CI compares SeaORM entity tables and route paths from both `api/src/router.rs`
and `api/src/lib.rs` against `tenant-isolation-matrix.json`, verifies every
entity appears in this prose inventory, and rejects stale named SQLite evidence.
The current gate is structural: method-level handlers, actor cases, selector
combinations, background jobs, caches, external exports, and PostgreSQL/MySQL
results remain explicit matrix gaps rather than inferred coverage.
